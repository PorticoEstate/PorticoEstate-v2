# BaseModel Implementation Summary

## What We've Created

I've successfully created a comprehensive, generic **BaseModel** class for the booking system that provides robust CRUD operations based on FieldMap and RelationshipMap configurations, inspired by the legacy `booking_socommon` class but modernized for PHP 8+ and Slim 4.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Generic BaseModel Class** (`/var/www/html/src/modules/booking/models/BaseModel.php`)

- **Modern PHP 8+ Architecture**: Full type hints, strict typing, and modern patterns
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Maintains method signatures compatible with `booking_socommon`
- **Field Map Driven**: All validation, sanitization, and marshaling based on centralized field definitions
- **Relationship Management**: Support for many-to-many, one-to-many, belongs-to, and has-one relationships
- **Transaction Support**: Built-in transaction handling for complex operations
- **Type-Safe Operations**: Proper marshaling/unmarshaling between PHP and database types
- **Custom Fields Integration**: Automatic integration with phpGroupWare custom fields system
- **JSON Storage Support**: Optional JSON storage for custom fields in a single database column

### 2. **Enhanced Event Model** 

- **Updated to extend BaseModel**: Inherits all CRUD functionality
- **Maintains existing API**: All existing methods and properties preserved
- **Improved relationship handling**: Uses BaseModel's generic relationship loading/saving
- **Better validation**: Enhanced field-level and cross-field validation
- **Custom fields enabled**: Supports dynamic custom fields for booking events

### 3. **Custom Fields System** (`CustomFields_Integration_Guide.md`)

- **Automatic Field Discovery**: Custom fields automatically retrieved from database
- **Type Safety**: Custom field data types mapped to BaseModel validation types
- **Seamless Integration**: Custom fields work with all BaseModel features
- **Choice Validation**: Radio/checkbox fields validated against defined choices
- **JSON Storage Option**: Store all custom fields as JSON in single database column

### 4. **Example Resource Model** (`/var/www/html/src/modules/booking/models/ResourceExample.php`)

- **Demonstrates BaseModel usage**: Shows how to create new models using the base class
- **Relationship examples**: Shows various relationship types (belongs-to, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- **Custom validation**: Example of model-specific validation logic
- **Convenience methods**: Shows how to add model-specific helper methods

### 4. **Comprehensive Documentation** (`README_BaseModel.md`)

- **Complete usage guide**: Step-by-step instructions for creating models
- **Field map configuration**: Detailed explanation of all field types and options
- **Relationship configuration**: Examples of all relationship types
- **CRUD operations**: Examples of create, read, update, delete operations
- **Migration guide**: How to convert existing `booking_socommon` models

## Key Capabilities

### 1. **CRUD Operations Compatible with Legacy Code**

```php
// Legacy booking_socommon style (still works)
$result = Event::add($eventData);
$result = Event::updateEntity($eventData);
$event = Event::readSingle($id);
$events = Event::read(['filters' => ['active' => 1]]);
$result = Event::deleteEntity($id);

// Modern BaseModel style (new capabilities)
$event = Event::find($id);
$events = Event::findWhere(['active' => 1], ['order_by' => 'name']);
$event = new Event($data);
$success = $event->save();
```

### 2. **Advanced Relationship Handling**

```php
// Many-to-many relationships (e.g., event resources, audience)
$event->saveRelationship('resources', [1, 2, 3]);
$resources = $event->loadRelationship('resources');

// One-to-many relationships (e.g., event comments, costs)
$comments = $event->loadRelationship('comments');

// Automatic relationship loading in readSingle()
$event = Event::readSingle(1); // Includes all relationships
```

### 3. **Type-Safe Field Handling**

```php
// Field map defines types, validation, and sanitization
'cost' => [
    'type' => 'decimal',
    'required' => true,
    'validator' => function($value) {
        return $value >= 0 ? null : 'Cost must be non-negative';
    }
],
'resources' => [
    'type' => 'intarray',
    'required' => true,
    'sanitize' => 'array_int'
]
```

### 4. **Powerful Query Building**

```php
$events = Event::read([
    'query' => 'meeting',              // Search in queryable fields
    'filters' => [
        'active' => 1,
        'building_id' => [1, 2, 3],    // IN clause
        'from_' => '>=2025-01-01'      // Comparison operators
    ],
    'sort' => 'from_',
    'dir' => 'DESC',
    'start' => 0,
    'results' => 50
]);
```

### 5. **Dynamic Custom Fields Integration**

```php
// Custom fields work automatically once configured
$event = new Event([
    'name' => 'Conference Meeting',
    'from_' => '2025-07-01 09:00:00',
    'custom_priority' => 'high',      // Custom field
    'custom_category' => 'business',  // Custom field
    'custom_tags' => ['urgent', 'vip'] // Custom checkbox field
]);

// Validation includes custom fields
$errors = $event->validate(); // Custom fields validated too

// Get complete field map (static + custom fields)
$allFields = Event::getCompleteFieldMap();

// JSON storage for many custom fields (optional)
// All custom fields stored in single 'json_representation' column
```

## Benefits Over Legacy Code

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Centralized field definitions eliminate code duplication
- Clear separation of concerns (model vs. database vs. validation)
- Modern, documented code that's easy to understand and extend

### 2. **Type Safety**
- Full PHP 8+ type hints prevent runtime errors
- Proper marshaling ensures data integrity between PHP and database
- Compile-time error detection for better development experience

### 3. **Extensibility**
- Easy to add new field types and validation rules
- Relationship system can handle complex data structures
- Plugin architecture for custom marshaling/unmarshaling

### 4. **Performance**
- Optimized queries with proper joins and indexing
- Lazy loading of relationships prevents unnecessary queries
- Efficient bulk operations for relationship management

### 5. **Developer Experience**
- Clear, consistent API across all models
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- IDE autocompletion and type checking

## Migration Path

For existing models extending `booking_socommon`:

1. **Change inheritance**: `extends booking_socommon` â†’ `extends BaseModel`
2. **Implement required methods**: `getTableName()`, `getFieldMap()`, `initializeFieldMap()`
3. **Convert field definitions**: Move from constructor arrays to field map format
4. **Define relationships**: Add relationship map for complex associations
5. **Update method calls**: Use new method names where beneficial (`updateEntity` vs `update`)

## Real-World Usage

The BaseModel is now ready for:

- **Event management**: Enhanced Event model with full relationship support
- **Resource management**: Can easily create Resource, Building, Activity models
- **Application processing**: Can modernize Application model with complex validation
- **User management**: Can handle user permissions and role relationships
- **Any new entities**: Quick model creation with full CRUD and relationship support

## Backward Compatibility

All existing code using the Event model will continue to work without changes, while new code can take advantage of the enhanced BaseModel capabilities. This provides a smooth migration path and allows gradual modernization of the booking system.

The BaseModel represents a significant upgrade to the booking system's data layer, providing modern, maintainable, and extensible foundation for all entity management while preserving compatibility with existing legacy code.
