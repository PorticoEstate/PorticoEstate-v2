# Calendar Synchronization Service Planning Document

## 1. **Objective**
Describe the main goal of the service.  
*Example:*  
Synchronize room bookings between the internal booking system and Outlook (Microsoft 365) room calendars, ensuring both systems reflect the current state of all room reservations.

---

## 2. **Scope**
- Which resources/rooms are in scope?
- Which calendars (Outlook, booking system) are involved?
- What types of events (create, update, delete, recurring, etc.)?

---

## 3. **Direction of Synchronization**
- [ ] Outlook → Booking System
- [ ] Booking System → Outlook
- [ ] Both directions (bi-directional)

---

## 4. **Triggers**
- How are changes detected in Outlook? (e.g., Microsoft Graph webhooks)
- How are changes detected in the booking system? (e.g., database triggers, API events)
- How often should fallback reconciliation run? (e.g., cron job every X minutes)

---

## 5. **Data Mapping**
- How are rooms/resources mapped between systems?
- How are events mapped? (e.g., unique IDs, custom properties)
- What fields must be synchronized? (title, time, organizer, etc.)

---

## 6. **Conflict Resolution**
- What happens if the same room is booked in both systems at the same time?
- Which system is authoritative, or how are conflicts resolved?

---

## 7. **Loop Prevention**
- How do we prevent infinite sync loops when an event is updated by the sync itself?

---

## 8. **Error Handling & Logging**
- How are errors handled and retried?
- Where are sync actions and errors logged?

---

## 9. **Security & Permissions**
- What permissions are required for Microsoft Graph?
- How is authentication handled for both systems?

---

## 10. **Architecture Overview**
- Will this be a standalone service, a cron job, or both?
- What technologies/libraries will be used? (e.g., PHP, Microsoft Graph SDK)
- How will the service be deployed and monitored?

---

## 11. **Edge Cases & Special Scenarios**
- Recurring events
- All-day events
- Cancellations
- Time zone differences
- Room unavailability

---

## 12. **Next Steps**
- [ ] Fill in each section with current understanding
- [ ] Review and refine with stakeholders
- [ ] Identify unknowns and research as needed
